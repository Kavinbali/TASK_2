                <h2>Jumpman MVP</h2>
                <p>We didn't invent the remix—but considering the material we get to sample, this one's a no-brainer. We took elements from the AJ6, 7 and 8, making them into a completely new shoe that celebrates MJ's first 3-peat championship run. With leather, textile and nubuck details, these sneakers honour one legacy while encouraging you to cement your own.</p>

                <ul>>>The upper is a mix of AJ6 and AJ7 elements: The tongue top and modified overlay reference the AJ6 while the semi-bootie lining homages the AJ7.</li>
                <ul>>>The embroidered Nike Air heel logo references the AJ6 and the moulded heel detail comes from the AJ8.
                </li>
                <li>>>The outsole design is a nod to the AJ6.

            Great traction, lightweight, responsive, enough support and impact protection, wallet-friendly, (nice looking on-court?). No, it’s not premium, but it’s all the other things you love to hear in performance reviews.
